# üè¶ Bank Marketing Campaign ‚Äì Term Deposit Prediction

This project analyzes a real-world **bank marketing dataset** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a **term deposit** based on information collected during telemarketing calls. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and popular data science libraries.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Load dataset (`bank-full.csv`)
  - Convert categorical features to numerical
  - Train-test split (80/20)
  - Normalize features using `StandardScaler`

- **Data Visualization**
  - Visual exploration of features using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps

- **Model Training & Evaluation**
  - Train a **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)** using `scikit-learn`
  - Use `GridSearchCV` to tune hyperparameters (`C`, `gamma`)
  - Evaluate model performance on test set using accuracy

- **Manual Logistic Regression Implementation**
  - Custom implementation from scratch
  - Cross-Entropy loss function
  - Gradient descent to update weights iteratively

## üß† Key Features

- **Real-World Dataset**: Data from a marketing campaign by a Portuguese bank
- **End-to-End ML Workflow**: From raw data to custom model
- **Visualization**: Multiple plots used to explore patterns and trends
- **Custom ML**: Logistic Regression built manually without using ML libraries
